```

## Workflow

### 1. Dataset Preparation

- Organize images and annotation files.
- Convert dataset into YOLO format if necessary.
- Update `solar_dataset.yaml` with dataset paths and class details.

### 2. Model Training

- Load YOLOv8 model (`yolov8n.pt`).
- Train using `solar-p-detection.ipynb`.
- Log training performance using MLflow.

### 3. Evaluation

- Compute metrics (IoU, mAP) using Pascal VOC and COCO methods.
- Analyze results in `solar-panel.ipynb`.

### 4. Inference & Deployment

- Run detection on test images.
- Deploy the model for real-time solar panel detection.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
- OpenCV
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- MLflow
- Shapely (for IoU calculation)
- supervision (for evaluation metrics)

## Future Scope

- Improve model accuracy with data augmentation.
- Optimize inference for real-time applications.
- Integrate the detection pipeline with IoT-based solar panel monitoring systems.
